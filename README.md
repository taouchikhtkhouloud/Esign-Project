# ESign Application

In a world where credibility and trust rest on solid foundations, the documents underlying civil projects are much more than just pieces of paper. They represent the pillars of transparency, legitimacy, and accountability. However, with the increasing complexity of projects and the decentralized nature of teams, it has become imperative to meet the challenge of preserving the integrity of these documents.

The eSign application was created to address the need for reconciling modern technology with the specific needs of Fabra Controle. It offers a secure digital space where documents are authenticated and preserved against unauthorized alteration.

## Features ðŸ“‘

### 1. User Authentication and Authorization

The eSign application employs a robust authentication system, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information. Permission levels are carefully set to ensure that each user only accesses the sections and actions that are appropriate for them.

### 2. Document and File Management

Simplify the management of complex documents with an organized and intuitive folder structure. Create, upload, edit, and delete documents in specific folders, making it easier to navigate and find relevant documents.

### 3. Integration of Digital Signature Technology

Digital signature technology ensures the authenticity and integrity of documents. Each signature is associated with a unique certificate, preventing any subsequent alteration of the document without detection.

### 4. User and Role Management

Maintain precise control over user actions and access with advanced user and role management. Define specific roles with permissions tailored to each level of responsibility.

### 5. Public Access to Signed Documents

Facilitate transparency and collaboration by allowing public access to certain signed documents. This feature enables communication with external stakeholders and builds trust in projects.

### 6. Creation of a Dashboard

A comprehensive dashboard provides users with an overview of current projects, documents, and actions. It allows real-time tracking of signature status, updates, and recent activities.

### 7. Audit Traces

Record detailed audit trails of all activities to ensure traceability and accountability. Every action, from opening a document to signing, is recorded with information such as date, time, and the user involved.
